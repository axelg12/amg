      <a href="https://tagplay.co/" class="Resume__link">Tagplay</a> allows you to keep everything up to date on your website using social media. My Bachelor project was to
      develop a extension to their service that allowed the user to create social media game, that we would automatically
      create in the Tagplay system. We then took care of counting who liked, commented and followed the rules set by the
      creator. It had the capability to pick a winner randomly, contacting them via social media and post automatically who
      won the game on social media. The project was a Python / Django backend with a ReactJS frontend. During this worked
      I worked alot with the Facebook, Instagram and Twitter APIs.
